# Sports Point

Created an e-commerce website called Sports Point where users can buy jerseys, sneakers, sports equipment and athleisure clothes. The website was made with the help of Springboot and Thymeleaf. The purpose of this project was to learn Spring. 

The website has CRUD functionalities along with login/register. The admins can add pages to the website. They can also add different categories and products. They also have the ability to delete and edit pages, categories and products.

Users have access to all the pages barring the admin section.

The languages used in this project was mainly Java (Spring) for back-end and HTML (Thymeleaf), CSS, JavaScript for front-end.
